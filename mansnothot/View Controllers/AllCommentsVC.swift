//Purpose: to see all the comments under a post

//TODO: have AllCommentsView as the initial view
    //should have "Add" right bar button item that lets you add comment - should segue to AddCommentVC??
    //should set up data source variable
    //should have a text field at the bottom of the view, on top of the tab, and when the textfield delegate didBeginEditing, it should segue to the AddCommentsVC or present the AddCommentView without a VC and animate the adding of the subview
    //nice to have: swipe options - let you flag, share, and edit?

class AllCommentsVC: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

    }
