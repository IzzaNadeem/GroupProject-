//Purpose: to show the user profile in the third tab

//TODO: should have ProfileView as initial view
//should have a log out button that segues back to the Log In screen and also log out the user (segues back to LoginVC)
//an alert controller should present on success/failure when changing display name
//an alert controller should present on success/failure when changing bio
//the button that allows you to change your profile picture should present an action that presents three options to the user:
//1. "Photo Library"
//2. "Take Photo"
//3. "Cancel" button - just dismisses the alert controller
//either option 1 or 2 should segue to some ImagePickerViewController or w/e, which will handle the taking of pictures, and maybe uses a delegate function to update this view controller's profile image in real time
//the button that lets you change display names could display an alert that asks you what to change the name to
//when users taps bio TextView, it will enter editing mode for the bio (use the textdidbeginediting delegate method) - Will display Alert upon saving successfully (present with dismiss view)
//the textView should animate from the regular size, and transition to a textview that takes up most of the screen?? And another view (ChangeBioView) will be laid on top, with a new textview that will be in the same place as the old textView, so it looks like there was an actual transition
//"all my posts" button should segue to AllMyPostsVC with all the user's post
