//Purpose: for logging into app

//TODO: have the login view as the initial view
    //should have proper text field delegates for each textfield
    //should present ForgotPassView (when forgot password button is clicked)
    //should present ForgotUserView (when forgot username button is clicked)
        //maybe included/not included based on how we’ll be logging in (with email only, or email or username)
    //Segue to HomePageVC upon successful log in

    //Maybe?? - we should decide tomorrow, tuesday: have a button at the bottom for if the user wants to create an account? check our group slack channel for the image maggie sent
        //should segue to CreateAccountVC
