//Purpose: let user edit posts in the MyPostsVC

//TODO: have EditMyPostView as the initial view
    //should have right bar button item "Edit" - edits the post if everything is required filled out
    //Required: Image? (optional) or PostText? (optional), Title, Category - you need at least an image OR post text, or else it won't post
    //should have left bar button item "Clear" - clears/resets all the fields
        //Sets image to nil, PostText to empty, Title to empty, and Category to empty

//tbh this one might a bit redundant compared to the new post VC which does a lot of the same things, but it also has some additional functions and the properties (the view) are from different instances

class EditMyPostVC: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

    }
